create manage_news.feature in the features directory (Review the Gherkin Given-When-Then syntax https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin)

export CUCUMBER_FORMAT=pretty # or config/cucumber.yml
rake cucumber

copy the regexp steps that cucumber generates to a new manage_news_steps.rb file in the step_definitions directory

rake cucumber
#Failing Tests!

use the Capybara examples (https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) and matchers (http://rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Node/Matchers) to fill out the pending step definitions

rake cucumber
#Still Failing!

rails generate rspec:model story
vi spec/models/story_spec.rb
# test-drive development of the model
# we'll take a short cut and implement with scaffold
rails generate scaffold story title:string content:text
rake db:migrate
rake cucumber # still fails, need to make homepage refer to story list

vi config/routes.rb
  root :to => "stories#index"
rake cucumber # still fails
  
rm public/index.html
rake cucumber # first scenario passes!

to address the next failure, we'll edit the controller
modify the create method:
        format.html { redirect_to(@story, :notice => 'Story was successfully created.') }
change @story to root_path

Now we've fixed one error, but the scenario still fails. We need to edit the index page so the description is not listed there.
